alt big ears festival app because the official festival app was BAD!\
[kotlin multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) targeting iOS and android. ui written in [compose muliplatform](https://www.jetbrains.com/compose-multiplatform/). there's a server module in there that doesn't do anything yet.
- open project in android studio, build, and run normally for android
- open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` in xcode to run the ios app

this project is the result of [vibe coding](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/) with [claude code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview) and spending too much money on anthropic api tokens. a fun experiment for a weekend project but the code is kind of bad!
